## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Pre-built Executable (Easiest!)
**For users who just want to run the application without any setup:**

1. **Go to the [Releases](../../releases) tab**
2. **Download** the latest `RobloxAudioBrowser.exe`
3. **Double-click** the executable to run - no installation required!

*The pre-built executable includes all dependencies and requires no Python installation.*

### Option 2: Automatic Setup (Recommended for Developers)
1. **Download** the repository
2. **Run** `run.bat` - this will automatically:
   - Create a Python virtual environment
   - Install all required dependencies
   - Launch the application

### Option 3: Manual Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/roblox-audio-browser.git
cd roblox-audio-browser

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment (Windows)
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python roblox_audio_browser.py
```

## üìã Requirements

- **Python 3.7+** (Python 3.8+ recommended)
- **Windows OS** (primarily tested on Windows 10/11)
- **Required Python packages** (automatically installed):
  - `pygame` - Audio playback
  - `tkinter` - GUI (usually included with Python)

## üéØ Usage

### Getting Started
1. **Launch** the application using `run.bat` or `python roblox_audio_browser.py`
2. **Scan** Roblox cache by clicking "üîç Scan Roblox Cache"
3. **Browse** found audio files in the list
4. **Select** a file to view detailed information
5. **Double-click** or use "‚ñ∂Ô∏è Play" to listen

### Key Features
- **Double-click** any file to play it immediately
- **Right-click** for context menu with export options
- **Use the filter** box to search through your audio collection
- **Adjust volume** with the slider during playback
- **View collection statistics** when no file is selected

### Default Roblox Cache Locations
The application automatically scans these directories:
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Roblox\http`
- `%TEMP%\Roblox\http`

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Multi-threaded scanning** - Uses ThreadPoolExecutor for efficient file processing
- **Async UI updates** - Non-blocking interface during operations
- **Memory efficient** - Processes files in chunks to avoid memory issues
- **Error resilient** - Graceful handling of corrupted or inaccessible files

### File Detection
- **Header analysis** - Examines file headers to identify audio formats
- **Size filtering** - Skips obviously non-audio files (too small/large)
- **Format support** - OGG Vorbis, MP3, WAV, FLAC, and more

### Performance
- **Concurrent processing** - Uses multiple CPU cores for scanning
- **Progress tracking** - Real-time updates every 10 files processed
- **Cancellable operations** - Stop long-running scans anytime
- **Smart caching** - Avoids re-scanning unchanged directories

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No audio files found"**
- Ensure Roblox has been run recently to populate cache
- Try scanning custom folders where you know audio files exist
- Check if antivirus is blocking access to Roblox directories

**"Could not play audio file"**
- File might be corrupted or not actually audio
- Try extracting as OGG and playing in external player
- Ensure pygame is properly installed

**"Permission denied" errors**
- Run as administrator if scanning system directories
- Check if Roblox is currently running (may lock cache files)

### Audio Format Support
- **Primary**: OGG Vorbis (most Roblox audio)
- **Secondary**: MP3, WAV, FLAC
- **Experimental**: M4A, AAC (detection only)
