   - Ensure these files are present:
     - `roblox_audio_browser.py`
     - `run.bat`
     - `requirements.txt`
     - `README.md`

3. **Run the Application**
   - Double-click `run.bat`, or
   - Open Command Prompt in the project folder and run:
     ```
     python -m venv .venv
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     python roblox_audio_browser.py
     ```

## ðŸŽ¹ Quick Usage Tips

## Troubleshooting

### "Python is not installed or not in PATH"
- Install Python from [python.org](https://python.org)
- During installation, check "Add Python to PATH"
- Restart your computer after installation

### "Failed to create virtual environment"
- Ensure you have the latest Python version
- Try running as administrator
- Update pip: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`

### "Failed to install required packages"

### Application won't start
- Ensure all files are in the same directory
- Check that Python 3.7+ is installed
- Try deleting the `.venv` folder and running `run.bat` again

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Python Installation
If you have multiple Python versions, you can specify which one to use:
1. Edit `run.bat`
2. Replace `python` with the full path to your preferred Python executable
3. Example: `C:\Python39\python.exe -m venv .venv`

### Development Setup
For developers who want to modify the code:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
